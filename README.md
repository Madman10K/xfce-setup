## Setup
1. Clone the repo with the `--recursive` argument
2. Copy the scripts into `/usr/bin`
3. Install rofi, polybar, kitty
4. Copy the contents of the contents of the `Config/kitty` folder into `~/.config/kitty`
5. Copy the contents of the `Polybar` folder into `~/.config/polybar`
6. To run polybar use `polybar main`
7. Copy the wallpapers into your desired wallpaper directory
8. Set the wallpaper up
9. Go to the xfce settings manager and set your colour theme and icon theme to `Gruvbox-Material-Dark`
10. Set your window manager theme to `clean`(will remove window borders and decorations)
## Copyright
This project is under the GNU GPL v3 due to a perl script in the `Scripts` folder. The wallpapers however are owned entirely by their creators. I probably found most of the sources but their authenticity can be debated since this is the internet
